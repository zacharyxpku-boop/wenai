# 🧬 Growth Engine

**What if your marketing experiments ran themselves?**

Autonomous growth experimentation for AI agents. Inspired by [Karpathy's autoresearch](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383) pattern applied to marketing: create experiments with hypotheses, collect data, run statistical analysis, auto-promote winners to a living playbook, and suggest what to test next.

Your AI agents stop guessing and start *knowing* what works.

## What You Get

- **🔬 Experiment Engine** — Create A/B or batch (up to 10 variants) experiments with hypotheses, track them, and let the math decide winners
- **📊 Bootstrap CI + Mann-Whitney U** — Real statistical rigor, not vibes. Non-parametric tests that work with small samples and non-normal distributions
- **📖 Auto-Playbook** — Winners automatically promote to a living playbook of empirically proven best practices
- **💡 Next-Experiment Suggestions** — The system knows what you haven't tested yet and suggests what to run next
- **📈 Weekly Scorecard** — Automated report across all channels: wins, trends, running experiments, discards
- **⚠️ Pacing Alerts** — Monitor campaign health, lead staging rates, and candidate pipelines against targets

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### 3. Run your first experiment

```bash
# Create an experiment
python3 experiment-engine.py create \
  --agent content \
  --hypothesis "Thread posts get 2x impressions vs single posts" \
  --variable "format" \
  --variants '["thread", "single"]' \
  --metric "impressions" \
  --cycle-hours 8

# Log data as it comes in
python3 experiment-engine.py log \
  --agent content \
  --experiment-id EXP-CONTENT-001 \
  --variant "thread" \
  --metrics '{"impressions": 4500, "clicks": 120, "replies": 8}'

# Score when you have enough data
python3 experiment-engine.py score \
  --agent content \
  --experiment-id EXP-CONTENT-001

# Check your playbook of proven winners
python3 experiment-engine.py playbook --agent content

# What should you test next?
python3 experiment-engine.py suggest --agent content
```

## Commands

### experiment-engine.py

The core engine. Manages the full experiment lifecycle.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `create` | Create a new A/B or batch experiment with a hypothesis |

### Statistical Methods

- **Mann-Whitney U test** — Non-parametric. Works with small samples. No normality assumption needed.
- **Bootstrap confidence intervals** — 1,000 resamples to estimate the true lift range.
- **Dual threshold** — Both statistical significance (p < 0.05) AND practical significance (≥15% lift) required to declare a winner. No more "statistically significant but useless" results.
- **Trending detection** — Early signal detection at p < 0.10 with 15+ samples, so you know what's promising before it's conclusive.

### Configurable Thresholds

| Parameter | Default | What It Controls |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| `P_WINNER` | 0.05 | p-value threshold for declaring a winner |
| `P_TREND` | 0.10 | p-value threshold for "trending" status |
| `LIFT_WIN` | 15.0% | Minimum lift required for "keep" decision |
| `BOOTSTRAP_ITERATIONS` | 1000 | Number of bootstrap resamples for CI |

## Integrating with Your AI Agents

The growth engine is designed to be called by AI agents (Claude Code, GPT, etc.) as part of their workflow:

```python
# In your agent's post-publishing hook:
import subprocess

# After publishing a social post, log the experiment data
subprocess.run([
    "python3", "experiment-engine.py", "log",
    "--agent", "content",
    "--experiment-id", current_experiment_id,
    "--variant", variant_used,
    "--metrics", json.dumps({"impressions": post_impressions, "clicks": post_clicks})
])

# Periodically score experiments
subprocess.run([
    "python3", "experiment-engine.py", "score",
    "--agent", "content",
    "--experiment-id", current_experiment_id
])

# Before creating new content, check the playbook
result = subprocess.run(
    ["python3", "experiment-engine.py", "playbook", "--agent", "content"],
    capture_output=True, text=True
)
# Parse playbook rules and apply them to new content
```
